    "When working with image, text, audio, or video data, you can use standard Python packages to load the data into a NumPy array, which can then be transformed into a ``torch.*Tensor``. However, for large datasets, computing gradients for all data points simultaneously isn't feasible. Therefore, we adopt a technique called **batching**, where the neural network is fed chunks of our data at a time. PyTorch offers the DataLoader class for efficient management of batching and data loading. By providing the ``DataLoader`` with the data and batch size, we obtain an iterable object that can be used for training or testing. It's a good practice to shuffle the data inside the loader to reduce biases during training."
